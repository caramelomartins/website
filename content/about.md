## About Me

I'm Hugo Martins, a Software and Infrastructure Engineer from Lisbon, Portugal. 

I like to build and break things. Lately, I’ve been working on tools that improve developer’s lives and productivity. Sometimes I also dabble in automating stuff and optimizing infrastructure. These days I write Python, Go and Kotlin.

Currently, **Senior Site Reliability Engineer** at [Talkdesk](https://www.talkdesk.com/), formerly [Claranet](http://www.claranet.co.uk/). I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Master's in Information and Business Systems. You can review some of my projects in the [Code](/code) and [Research](/research) sections.

## About This Site

This website is my home online.

It serves as a learning experiment, as well as a place for sharing and collecting my thoughts and interests. It will serve content about technology, with occasional forays into culture and other subjects of interest to me. 

It is also a place for me to share information about my projects and whatever I happen to be working on at any given moment.
