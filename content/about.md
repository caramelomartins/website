## About Me

I'm Hugo Martins, a Software and Infrastructure Engineer from Lisbon, Portugal. 

I have an interest in building tools that expand the platforms with which people work, helping them create more and better things. I’m interested in applying engineering to find solutions to problems and to automate tasks.

I like to build and break things. These days I write Python and Go, while looking for ways to optimize and automate infrastructure, at the same time. 

Currently, **Site Reliability Engineer** at [Talkdesk](https://www.talkdesk.com/), formerly [Claranet](http://www.claranet.co.uk/). I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Information and Business Systems. You can review some of my projects in the [Code](/code) and [Research](/research) sections.

## About This Site

This website is my home online. 

It serves as a learning experiment, as well as a place for sharing and collecting my thoughts and interests. It will serve content about technology, with occasional forays into culture and other subjects of interest to me. 

It is also a place for me to share information about my projects and whatever I happen to be working on at any given moment.
