I like to build and break things. Lately, I’ve been working on tools that improve developer’s lives and productivity. Sometimes I also dabble in automating stuff and optimizing infrastructure. These days I write Python, Go and Kotlin.

I try to use this page for sharing whatever I am interested in or learning. Here you can also know more [about me](/about/), what [projects](/code/) I am working on or have a look at my [past research](/research).

You can get future updates by following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/caramelomartins), subscribing via [RSS](/index.xml) or [subscribe to a monthly newsletter](https://hugomartins.substack.com/) .
