I like to build and break things. Currently, **Site Reliability Engineer** at [Talkdesk](https://www.talkdesk.com/), formerly [Claranet](https://www.claranet.co.uk/). These days I write Python, Go and Kotlin, while looking for ways to optimize and automate infrastructure.

I try to use this page for sharing whatever I am interested in or learning. Here you can also know more [about me](/about/), what [projects](/code/) I am working on or have a look at my [past research](/research).

You can get future updates via [RSS](/index.xml).
