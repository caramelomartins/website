## Contributions

### Tools

- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is a Python testing framework. I started using `pytest` for some of my Python projects and decided to contribute back by fixing up some identified problems in the documentation. I am currently a contributor and a member of the _pytest-dev_ team. ([pytest-3.6.4](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/announce/release-3.6.4.html), [pytest-6.2.0](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/announce/release-6.2.0.html), [Commits](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commits?author=caramelomartins))
- [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. I have been a user of the application for a few months and, when Hacktoberfest 2019 came around I thought it would be appropriate to give back. I contributed with some documentation patches and some new hooks that had been requested by the community. ([PyInstaller 3.6](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/v3.6/CREDITS.html#contributions-to-pyinstaller-3-6), [Commits](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/commits?author=caramelomartins))
- [kotest](https://github.com/kotest/kotest),  a powerful, elegant and flexible test framework for Kotlin. I've contributed with documentation fixes and suggestion for enhancements. ([Kotest 4.5.0](https://kotest.io/docs/changelog.html#450-may-2021), [Commits](https://github.com/kotest/kotest/commits?author=caramelomartins))
- [kubernetes-client](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client), a Java client for Kubernetes & OpenShift. Made a small contribution for the mock servers used in tests. ([Commits](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/commits?author=caramelomartins))

### Documentation

- [CFDocs](https://cfdocs.org/) is a repository that holds documentation for the ColdFusion Markup Language. Since I had the need to learn the language I have contributed with [some documents](https://github.com/foundeo/cfdocs/commits?author=caramelomartins) to the project. I did this because I used the website as a source of knowledge and wanted to give back. ([Commits](https://github.com/foundeo/cfdocs/commits?author=caramelomartins))
- [Rocket.Chat.Docs](https://rocket.chat/docs/) is the documentation for the [Rocket.Chat's](https://rocket.chat/) API. While investigating their API I was able to contribute back a [patch for the documentation](https://github.com/rocketchat/docs/commits?author=caramelomartins) website. ([Commits](https://github.com/rocketchat/docs/commits?author=caramelomartins))
- [Nextclould Documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/) is the documentation for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/). I contributed to this as part of my Hacktoberfest's participation, in 2017, with a couple of pull requests to fix some identified issues. ([Commits](https://github.com/nextcloud/documentation/commits?author=caramelomartins))
- [Linux Dash](https://github.com/afaqurk/linux-dash) is a simple & low-overhead web dashboard for linux systems. I wrote the initial Portuguese translation of the documentation. ([Commits](https://github.com/afaqurk/linux-dash/commits?author=caramelomartins))

### Translation

- [KeeWeb](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb) is a cross-platform password manager compatible with KeePass. I have helped with the translation of the application from English to Portuguese.
