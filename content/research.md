While studying to get my Master’s in Information and Business Systems, I had the opportunity to do research. I focused on understanding decentralized qualification’s verification under existing access control models, in particular leveraging blockchain-based technologies.

I am interested in the topics of Information Security, Access Control, Decentralized Applications and Blockchains. Particularly, defining how all of those overlap and in what ways we can improve our existing systems, with new technology or new applications of older technology.

## Projects

I built [Blocked](https://github.com/caramelomartins/Blocked), which is a proof-of-concept application built on top of [Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth), for verifying educational qualifications on a decentralized blockchain.
