## Projects

While studying to get my Master’s in Information and Business Systems, I had the opportunity to do research. Said research focused on understanding decentralized qualification’s verification under existing access control models.

I built [Blocked](https://github.com/caramelomartins/Blocked), which is a proof-of-concept application built on top of [Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth), for verifying educational qualifications on a decentralized blockchain.

## Interests

I am interested in the topics of Information Security, Access Control, Decentralized Applications. Particularly, defining how all of those overlap and in what ways we can improve our existing systems, with new technology or new applications of older technology.

After I concluded my Master's thesis I have shifted my focus from academic research, diving more into open-source contributions, improving my understanding of the DevOps culture and operational applications of it, as well as understanding how to improve the reliability and security of systems, while maintaining flexibility and agility in software development.
