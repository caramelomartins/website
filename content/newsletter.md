I've been writing a monthly newsletter called _Disposable Archetypes_ for a few months. Mostly about software, infrastructure and computer science. Occasionally about books and culture. It also includes a recap of the writing I've done throughout that month. 

If you believe you might be interested in reading it, you should subscribe:

<form
  action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/caramelomartins"
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/caramelomartins', 'popupwindow')"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" />
  <input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed" />
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
</form>
