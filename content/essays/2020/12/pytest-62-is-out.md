I'm not one to write about release notes and release announcements but this one is special for me. [pytest 6.2.0](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/announce/release-6.2.0.html) has been released and it includes my [ first core contribution to pytest]({{< ref "/essays/2020/11/improving-pytests-collection-output" >}}) in which I helped improve the output of running `pytest` in collection-only mode. You can see more details about this in [#7875](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/7875). I'm thrilled about this release and I advice anyone with motivation and time to contribute to this project which has such awesome maintainers!
