It has been a bit quiet for a bit in here. I'm going to quick start a new round of essays with a musical one.

_Menagere_ is a completely different album from most of Bill Wither's masterpieces. It has some upbeat soulful characteristics, with a high tempo and some tunes that are full of joy. It doesn't have as much raw emotion but it still distills seduction and joy.

Released in 1977, it didn't have impeccable commercial success, it seems, but it has given has _"Lovely Day"_. This song is not only brilliant and a genuine masterpiece but it also happens to be one of my favorite songs from Bill Withers.
