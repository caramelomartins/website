Last January 15th, Signal had an [outage](https://www.engadget.com/signal-recovers-from-outage-183256503.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS91cmw_c2E9dCZyY3Q9aiZxPSZlc3JjPXMmc291cmNlPXdlYiZjZD0mdmVkPTJhaFVLRXdpTzZkUF9sS3J1QWhYRW5Gd0tIYmJPQTJBUUZqQUNlZ1FJQkJBQyZ1cmw9aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tJTJGc2lnbmFsLXJlY292ZXJzLWZyb20tb3V0YWdlLTE4MzI1NjUwMy5odG1sJnVzZz1BT3ZWYXcySllaUkE3SXdXSHByaUZSRnoteTF6&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG8yHMsdyzXFkgVEYT2qmVVC3KH1GZs40JvP0TFMs_TDxh9Y2ctOnUSIs6Tvz3D0HN3GKgdY8RcgnacnwdJVGwtfvUVB3dtxVul4yxcC__eWQxBx_LEPTlX2GoTfEQ2YKTeKNFRNF3jf_uE5kCZAcLprAg16zNa0aai9_cvkZA5f) [of](https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/16/signal-interference-messaging-app-struggling-with-downtime-in-wake-of-newfound-popularity/) [epic](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22235707/signal-back-app-privacy-encrypted-outage) [proportions](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/elon-musk-responds-to-signals-global-outage-tweet-after-millions-of-new-sign-ups.html). WhatsApp's mistakes with the communication of their privacy changes, along with the fact that they are considering making privacy modifications, lead to a surge of new users trying to use Signal. This surge of new users was too much for Signal's infrastructure to bear.

Signal's server-side code has pretty much been stable throughout the outage, which indicates they are either running a different server code on their infrastructure, which is highly likely given that the [last modification to Signal's server code was on April 2020](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server/commit/3432529f9c018d75774ce89f3207b18051c26fe7), or they had problems mostly caused by their clients. Or a combination of both of these.

Although there's no official explanation as to why this outage happened, according to some [recent commits](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/c95f0fce6ee3b78ff82fde865b2ee49288e1303f) in the Android client, made almost exactly after the outage started, it appears that the clients were actually worsening the situation by constantly retrying after a failure that resulted from the server's rejection of the updates - effectively creating even more load for the servers to bear with. There's also been some work related with session resets and automatic retries, with feature flags. I can only wonder if the clients caused more harm than good to an already bad issue on the server-side.

Signal's outage exposes a deeper issue though. In a world where there are huge technological monopolies, smaller competitors can have problems, not only with user adoption, but also with actually being able to support the kind of loads that the servers of big technology companies support. This outage has most probably been caused by infrastructure issues. I'd guess that the infrastructure didn't scale fast enough for the amount of users flocking to Signal and, in the end, in broke. This poses a question: in a world where users changing from one platform to another causes an outage, where are users going to ?

While I use Signal, and was considering moving completely to Signal after Whatsapp's rampant diregard for, at least, keeping a facade about privacy-caring, their outage will have, _probably_, driven away a lot of users that were going to move from Whatsapp and were left with a bitter taste on their mouth.

It is obvious that these smaller competitors, with less capital to invest, need to have the infrastructure that supports their size, considering scalability to a certain degree, but will never have the ability to have infrastructure laying around for user increases that are orders of magnitude higher than their current user base, and this is fine. _But_ if these smaller companies can't handle high increases in their user base, when users are willing to leave their competitors, this leaves users in a grey area of either sticking with the existing application they are using, or having to accept that there _are_ differences in availability between these two companies and, most probably, there will ever be.
