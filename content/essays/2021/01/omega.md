Since the start of this year, I've been going through recommendations for the best jazz releases of 2020, from [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/21/the-10-best-jazz-albums-of-2020), [Jazzwise](https://www.jazzwise.com/features/article/top-20-jazz-albums-of-2020), [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/arts/music/best-jazz-albums.html) and [Slate](https://slate.com/culture/2020/12/best-jazz-albums-2020.html). I've even built a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/60hTOrK8ADkIHz0l7f6DS5?si=vTYd3vxXSn2RZJfbhWPemw) with all of these, amounting to 426 songs and a bit more than 34 hours of music. I've listened to 7 or 8 of these recommendations already and, as of now, I have found _Omega_  to be my favorite yet.

_Omega_ is the debut album of Immanuel Wilkins , a young saxophonist, produced by Jason Moran and released by Blue Note Recordings in 2020. _Omega_ is powerful, vibrant and eclectic, at times familiar but still completely unexpected. It is truly a remarkable release from such a young artist, 22 years old, and we can only hope for a bright future from this young saxophonist.
